# Resources Fork of Google's libphonenumber

This fork is intended to be resource package for composer to provide Phone Numbers
parsable data to other libraries.

I intend to pull updates from the original google's repo sometime.

Some unnecessary for the PHP "port" files were removed, but any License info or Contributors
info are persisted as-is for purpose of recognition/appreciation 
(And legally I'm not allowed to do that anyway!).

Despite the fact that it's for PHP codebase, I do not plan to put almost anything PHP
related, I would love to keep it as simple as clone code be, but packaged for composer :).

This fork useless at this point.
